My Personal CV Done in LaTeX

It is in French

Only the tex file and its compiled pdf are mine; I've used XeTeX to compile it

All *sty and *cls files are from the excellent [moderncv](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv) Package; under the The LaTeX Project Public LiÂ­cense

Except for [fontawesome.sty](gist.github.com/sway/3101743)
